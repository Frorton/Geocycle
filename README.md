# Geocycle Go

Geocycle Go is a command-line program written in Go that allows users to compare the geometry of two bicycles based on user input.

## Features

- **Bike Geometry Comparison**: Users can input the geometry (such as wheelbase, head tube angle, seat tube angle, etc.) of two bikes, and the program will compare them to determine which bike might be a better fit for their preferences or needs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go installed on your system. You can download and install it from [here](https://golang.org/dl/).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/geocycle-go.git`


Navigate to the project directory:

`cd geocycle-go`

Build the program:

`go build`

Run the program:

`./geocycle-go`

Usage

    When prompted, input the geometry values for the first bike.
    Repeat the process for the second bike.
    The program will then compare the two bikes' geometry and provide an analysis of their differences.
